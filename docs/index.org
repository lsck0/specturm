* PLAN

- [ ] event hooks
- [ ] more asset system work (CPU / GPU resources, async)
- [ ] render primitives + gpu resource management (does this make sense in the asset system?)
- [ ] ui system: widgets, layout, styling
- [ ] debug ui: profiling, memory, console
- [ ] entity system
- [ ] rendering system
- [ ] audio system
- [ ] physics system

* OTHER TODOs

- [ ] buffered logging to file
- [ ] job system / task / multithreadding scheduler
- [ ] more datastructures: heap, ring buffer, maybe graphs/trees
- [ ] basic nn library: tensors, layers, autograd --> NEAT implementation
- [ ] CI
